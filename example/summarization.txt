Snow White is the daughter of a queen who dreamed of having a daughter like her. She was born with black hair like the ebony frame of the window, white skin like the snow that covers the frame, and red lips like the drop of blood that fell. ’s beautiful features turned frightening. Her face wrinkled with anger. No, the queen was not a woman who would put up with being less beautiful than a younger girl. She asked a young hunter who was bringing game to the castle kitchen to drag Snow White deep into the woods, cut out her heart and bring it to the Queen. The queen struck the hunter as hard as possible. She finally managed to make him confess that he had not killed Snow White and where he had sent her. The Queen had the hunter put in prison. It was clear to her that if she wanted to get rid of her stepdaughter, she would have to do it herself. After much thought, she decided to prepare something worse than death for her. The ever-cheerful dwarves were in a daze. sleeping, but they couldn’t wake her up. For days they tried everything they had ever heard of, but Snow White would not wake up. Finally, they put her in a glass coffin.
